    "# Coupled Map Lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for analyzing spatical dynamics, with discrete time, discrete space and continuous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Canonical Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a canonical procedure to construct lattice coupled maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a set of field variables on a lattice.\n",
    "- Decompose the phenomena concerned into independent processes.\n",
    "- Replace each process with simple parallel dynamics on a lattice. This represents nonlinear transformation of state variable(s) at each lattice point and/or a coupling term among suitably chosen neighbors.\n",
    "- Execute each unit dynamics in succession\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Consider a phenomenon generated by a local chaotic process and a spatial diffusion process. Let us take a state variable xn(i) for discrete time n=0,1,2,⋯ over a one-dimensional lattice with sites i=1,2,⋯,N\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, take a one-dimensional map as the simplest representative chaos and a discrete Laplacian operator for the diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, consider a phenomenon, generated by a local chaotic process and spatial diffusion process. Let us take a state variable xn(i) for discrete time n=0,1,2,⋯ over a one-dimensional lattice with sites i=1,2,⋯,N\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Now take a one-dimensional map as a simplest representative of chaos and a discrete Laplacian operator for the diffusion, given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{'}_{n}(i) = f(x_{n}(i)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    " where $x^{'}_{n}$ is introduced as a virtual variable for an intermediate step. Then the discrete Laplacian operator for diffusion is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1}(i) = (1-\\epsilon)x^{'}_{n}(i) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\{ x^{'}_{n}(i+1) + x^{'}_{n}(i-1) \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can combine the above two processes into :\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1}(i) = (1-\\epsilon)f(x_{n}(i)) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\{ f(x_{n}(i+1)) + f(x_{n}(i-1)) \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The mapping function f(x) is chosen according to the type of local chaos. For example, the logistic map (f(x)=rx(1−x)) can be chosen as a typical model for chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting different procedures, models for different types of spatially extended dynamic phenomena can be constructed:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  For example, for problems of phase transition dynamics, it is useful to adopt a map with bistable fixed points (e.g., f(x)=tanhx ) as local dynamics, which is used for phase transition kinetics.\\\n",
    "- Several extensions are possible by adopting different procedures for local dynamics and coupling. For example, to discuss open-flow (such as pipe flow), unidirectional coupling is relevant, as given by :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1}(i) = (1-\\epsilon)f(x_n(i)) + \\epsilon f(x_n(i-1))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another choice of coupling is a mean field-type global computing : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = (1 - \\epsilon) f(x_n(i)) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{N} \\sum_{j} f(x_n(j))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which has extensively been studied as a prototype of collective chaos, while chaos networks are investigated by using coupling on given networks\n",
